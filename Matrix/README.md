				Matrix Manipulation


Purpose:
Create 3 different functions and files named Graph, Stacks, and Path. The Graph function will create the graph and allow the user to create a matrix with the sides and lengths of the functions. The Stacks function on the other hand will create a system to backtrack and remove steps of the path. The last function Path was made to create the path and follow it and alter it as you go.

Structures: 
Graph: create and alter a matrix with the vertices and sides.
Stack: allows you to backtrack and remove steps for the path
Path: Create a path and alter it as one goes through the paths
